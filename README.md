GenAv (aka Operator, aka Holy Avenger).
=======================================

What's it?
----------
This project had started from a personal need: clean some viruses 
which current scanners back then did not recognize on my computer. 
It's not data-driven which means it contains ad-hoc code for 
each and every virus it detects which I think is 8 :) It wasn't the
most sustainable AV project.

FatalVision UI:

The source code contains three variants: 

 - operator.pas: Old TurboVision based UI
 - genav.pas: FatalVision based UI.
 - avenger.pas: Command-line (which I think was the way to go but too 
 young to run away from the urge to code cool looking UIs)
 
Why release the code?
---------------------
Mostly for educational purposes. That is definitely not the right 
way to write a generic AV software. However considering the requirements
vs effort I think I kept a good balance, and the software itself
served me really well in it's time.

There was much more advanced AV projects originated from Turkey such as 
ARA by Bulent Eren which was data-driven and contained heuristic 
scanners as well.
